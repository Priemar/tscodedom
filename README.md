TsCodeDom is a .net implementation for where you can built / generate Typescript code based on an .net object model.

>This code was written years ago and used in a generator, to generate classes / interfaces / methods from a openApi documentation.*
>There are many cases which are not handled or implemented yet (sure its an alpha), but it should be a good base for further develpment*

TsCodeDom is a good base and is super easy to extend.

If there is a need in the open source community for a typescript code dom im looking forward for ppl who are interested to maintain this project.

**Feel free to contact me.**

*Currently im not working on this project, i just wanted to share it if someone needs a tsCodeDom*

## Documentation

- the best documentation is the code itself. Unit tests should be a good starting point. There are unittest for creating imports/exports/interfaces/classes etc..

## Getting Started

currently this is an alpha version, so the `tsCodeDom` is not available as nuget packages.

- clone the repo and build TsCodeDom -> add the dll, or simply add the TsCodeDom project to your solution

## Issues

If you identify any errors in the library, or have an idea for an improvement, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Priemar/tscodedom/issues).

## Planned

- Looking for someone who will maintain this project
